## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Local Embedding** Works with local and OpenAI embedding
- **MultiModality** Works with text and image and will soon expand to audio
- - **Python Interface:** Packaged as a Python library for seamless integration into your existing projects.
- **Efficient:** Optimized for speed and performance, with core functionality written in Rust.
- **Scalable:** Store embeddings in a vector database for easy retrieval and scalability.


## ðŸ’¡ToDo

- **Vector Database** Add functionalities to integrate with any Vector Database

## ðŸ’š Installation

`
pip install embed-anything`


Requirements:

Please check if you already have the OpenAI key in the Environment variable. We have only released the OpenAI embedder library so far. Please stay tuned for updates for the local embeddings as well.
