twinstars_meera_gaura #AD We all have our own daily 
hygiene routine, but what about daily intimate hygiene? 
You would be surprised to know that just plain water, soap 
with its harsh chemicals, or any treated product are a no-no 
to maintain intimate health. We need a gentle care down 
there with @myeveca re Intimate Wash -for 24hr malodor 
protection with natural ingredients. 
When you make EveCare a part of your daily hygiene 
routine, you have yourself a great cleanser. It prevents 
discomfort caused by an itchy feeling. I can't stand that... 
and it has a way of happening at the most awkward 
momentsl I'd do anything to avoid that and EveCare really 
helpsl 
Don't wait any longerl I'll let you try it out for yourself. Shop

 CREA TE
There is a plethora of bath and hygiene products available in the market. Recently, as I was
browsing through these products, one of them caught my attention – EveCare Intimate Wash .
Enclosed in a pretty pink and purple packaging, it naturally appealed immensely to my female
sensibilities. I believed I had found a product that ticked all the right boxes for me — made with
natural ingredients like milk protein and chamomile and dermatologically-tested. As I read more
about it, I just had to get it right away!EveCare  had really piqued my interest and I started reminiscing about my journey into intimate
hygiene.
Intimate hygiene - Two words we don't hear too often in day-to-day conversation. Even amongst
women. I remember when I was about to get married, I had a lot of questions about intimate
hygiene but just didn’t know whom to ask. A married friend eventually came to my rescue. She
told me that she used a mild soap to maintain hygiene in the intimate area and that I could do the
same.. I was grateful for her advice but wasn't too sure about it. What about hectic days at work or
when I would be travelling? What about the odour after a long day? And, then there were
problems like itching and dryness.I n t i m a t e  H y g i e n e  f o r  W o m e n :  I s  I t  I m p o r t a n t ?

https://www.momspresso.com/parenting/its-my-world/article/intimate-hygiene-for-women-is-it-important-ghzhsaokpn5y 2/3That’s when I decided to do some research on my own. I learnt that feminine hygiene should be a
part of daily self-care and not just during my periods. I also realised that I should have started
this self-care a long time ago, maybe as early as my teens. Today, using an intimate hygiene wash
has become a part of my everyday routine, much like a face wash.
The reason I decided to give EveCare Intimate wash  a try is because it came across as a very
promising product. For me personally, the biggest benefit is that it is non-toxic and free of
parabens which makes it gentle on the skin. The intimate wash is made with natural ingredients,
making it safe for everyday use. 
To top it all, EveCare  helps maintain a healthy and ideal pH of 3.5, unlike soap and water. While
the combination of soap and water may seem harmless, in reality, it’s a big no-no for two reasons.
First, soap contains chemicals and fragrances that are too harsh for the delicate skin in our
intimate area. Second, when soaps are used to wash intimate areas, they can change the pH levels
and this can affect the healthy balance of the bacteria. It can lead to growth of unhealthy bacteria
which ultimately leads to malodor.
What I especially liked about EveCare  is that it is antibacterial. It thoroughly cleanses the skin
without causing any irritation. Better still, with regular use, it offers relief from irritation, without
causing any dryness.
Another thing that caught my attention was this product offers protection from odour for the
entire day! In fact, if fighting bad odour is a top priority for you, I would recommend that you opt
for EveCare Refreshing intimate wash . It leaves you feeling fresh all day with a fragrance that is
hypoallergenic, unlike regular soap. This means that you don’t have to worry about it irritating
your sensitive skin.
With EveCare intimate wash, I have finally found a friend to confide in! A friend who gives my
intimate area all the care it needs and deserves. Whether you choose EveCare Classic  or EveCare
Refreshing  intimate wash, I’m sure your intimate area will thank you for it.

3/2/23, 11:39 PM Evecare Ayurvedic Treatment in Kerala
https://amaltamara.com/curative-programmes/eve-care/ 1/5
Eve Care Programme
The Eve Care Programme helps revitalise hormonal imbalances caused because of stress,
incorrect lifestyle, use of contraceptives, or chemicals along with poor nutrition. Ayurveda gives
great importance to various physiological conditions a woman goes through in her life.
This starts from the care to be taken for a woman from the time she attains menarche to various
pathological conditions that women often encounter in her life like menstrual disorders,
infertility, polycystic ovarian disease, endometriosis, uterine  broids as well as health
conditions related to pre, peri and post-menopausal syndrome. All these conditions are taken
care of by effective treatments.

Respected Madam/Sir, 
Subject: Reply to rebuttal letter dated February 14, 2023 
We write under instructions from and on behalf of our Client, Wipro Enterprises Private Limited, of the 
address Wipro House, No. 8, 7th Main, 80 Feet Road, Koramangala 1st Block, Bengaluru, Karnataka, 
560034 India (hereinafter referred to as 'our Client', which expression shall, unless repugnant to the context 
thereof, include its predecessors-in-title, subsidiaries and affiliates) in furtherance to your rebuttal letter 
dated February, 14, 2023 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Notice') issued from and on behalf of Himalaya 
Wellness Company (hereinafter referred to as 'you', 'yours', 'your company'). 
At the outset, all the contentions, claims and averments made in the Notice are denied, except for those 
that are expressly admitted to being true in this Reply. It is further stated that any claims made in the 
Notice are not to be deemed as being admitted for want of specific denials herein. 
In our reply letter dated December 06, 2022, we have already reiterated that our client is a household name 
throughout India owing to its extensive presence across several numerous business sectors, and that the 
specific details pertaining to our client's background and its trademarks are not repeated herein for the 
sake of brevity. Our client has been an honest adopter of the mark in respect of intimate care, and that the 
goods sold under both these marks are under completely different classes bearing distinct specification.

Worldwide, women use a variety of intimate hygiene prod-
ucts as part of their daily cleansing routine. These practices are impacted by many factors, including personal preference, cultural norms, religious practices, and guidance from health care professionals. Although there is abundant literature on the vaginal environment, little is known about the vulvar area and how personal hygiene practices can affect its bio-logical and physiological stability. More specifically, there is little published in the medical literature about intimate femi-nine hygiene as it relates to external topical washes and the role intimate feminine hygiene plays in managing unpleasant symptoms and supporting overall intimate health.
This article describes vulvovaginal physiology and the 
relevance of transient and resident microbiota as it relates to common vulvovaginal disorders. It also reviews global feminine hygiene practices and the potential benefits and risks of external feminine vulvar washes in overall femi-nine intimate health.There has been a recent increase in female intimate 
wash products on the market, making this topic timely and relevant to a wide range of women and their health care professionals.
Physiology of the vulvovaginal area
The vulvovaginal area
The vulva is the first line of defense to protect the genital 
tract from infection. Contaminants often collect in the vul-var folds, and increased moisture, sweating, menses, and hormonal fluctuations influence vulvar microbial growth Role of female intimate hygiene in 
vulvovaginal health: Global hygiene practices and product usage
Ying Chen1, Elizabeth Bruning1, Joseph Rubino1 and Scott E Eder2
Abstract
Women use various feminine hygiene products, often as part of their daily cleansing routine; however, there is a paucity of published medical literature related to the external vulva and how personal hygiene practices can affect it. This review article provides background information on the physiological changes that occur during women’s lives and reviews the relevance of transient and resident microbiota as they relate to common vaginal and vulvar disorders. It also discusses the need for female intimate hygiene, common practices of feminine hygiene from a global perspective, and the potential benefits of using suitable external, topical feminine vulvar washes to minimize the risk of vulvovaginal disorders and to improve overall intimate health in women around the world. Supported by international guidelines, daily gentle cleansing of the vulva is an important aspect of feminine hygiene and overall intimate health. Women should be encouraged to choose a carefully formulated and clinically tested external wash that provides targeted antimicrobial and other health benefits without negatively impacting on the natural vulvovaginal microbiota.

and species balance, potentially resulting in odor and vul-
vovaginal infection.
Vulvar skin differs from other skin sites in hydration, 
friction, permeability
, and visually discernible irritation 
and is more susceptible to topical agents than forearm skin because of its increased hydration, occlusion, and fric-tional properties.
1–5 The non-keratinized vulvar vestibule 
is likely to be more permeable than keratinized skin.1 
Genital skin is unique in that it is covered by a thin stratum corneum containing large hair follicles, making it easier for microbial and other substances to permeate the skin.
6
The vagina is the fibromuscular canal extending from 
its external opening in the vulva to the cervix and is com-posed mainly of smooth muscle covered with a non-kerati-nized epithelial lining, which, until the menopause, is thick, with folds kept moist by fluid secreted through the vaginal wall and mucus from cervical and vestibular glands (Table 1).
Microflora
Although knowledge about the microbial composition of the external vulvar area is in its infancy, maintenance of the microbiota ratio is anticipated to play a key role in overall vulvovaginal health. Data have shown that the nor -
mal vulvar flora includes vaginal, urethral, and colonic microbes as well as microbes characteristic of intertrigi-nous skin.
7,8 Various studies of healthy women have shown 
that the microbiota of the vulva is diverse, with no single species common to all women and these may include staphylococci, micrococci, diphtheroids, lactobacilli, streptococci, Gram-negative rods, yeasts, and species of fecal origin.
7,9–11 Vulvar flora may also affect the prolifera-
tion of exogenous pathogens that cause vaginal and uri-nary tract infections.
7
The vaginal microflora composition is better under -
stood. It was previously thought that a healthy vagina was dominated by Lactobacillus, which is a non-sporing, Gram-positive bacilli that produce lactic acid, resulting in an acidic environment (pH 3–4).
12 These Lactobacilli pre-
vent colonization by other bacteria in the vagina (including pathogens) via competition for epithelial cell receptors and through inhibition of growth by generation of antimicro-bial compounds in collaboration with innate host defenses (e.g. periodic hormonal cycling promoting glycogen release and constant sloughing of bacteria-containing epi-thelial cells) to maintain a healthy vaginal ecosystem.
13 
However, the composition of healthy vaginal flora is more variable than initially thought, and in some healthy women, Lactobacilli are absent and replaced by other lactic acid–producing bacteria, such as Atopobium vaginae, Megasphaera spp., and/or Leptotrichia spp. In some cases, asymptomatic, reproductive-age women are colonized by potentially pathogenic species (e.g. Gardnerella vaginalis, 
Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans),
14 and thus, the 
definition of healthy versus unhealthy vaginal microbiome is complex.
13
The composition of the vaginal microflora fluctuates as 
a function of internal factors (age, hormonal shifts (e.g. during menarche, menses, and pregnancy), and infec-tions)
13 and various external factors (e.g. hygiene prac-
tices, sexual intercourse, the use of antibiotics, and hormone replacement therapy).
15 Several studies suggest 
differences in normal vaginal flora based on ethnicity,16 
with communities dominated by Lactobacillus spp. in 80.2% and 89.7% of Asian and White women, respec-tively, but in only 59.6% and 61.9% of Hispanic and Black women, respectively.
16 However, these differences may be 
partially attributed to differences in hygiene practices among various ethnic groups.
17 A longitudinal study 
assessed the vaginal microbiome throughout full-term, uncomplicated pregnancies and found low diversity (two species dominated; Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus iners) and high stability throughout preg-nancy.
18 An individual’s skin microbiome appears to be 
affected by birth mode19,20 (cesarean vs vaginal birth), Table 1.  Physiological characteristics of the vulvar and vaginal area.

which may impact 
immune development21 and have longer 
term implications for microbial diversity. Dominguez-
Bello and colleagues22 demonstrated that the skin microbi-
ome of cesarean-born infants can, at least in part (through vaginal microbial transfer), be restored to what would be expected following a vaginal birth; however, additional studies are needed to elucidate long-term health benefits.
Besides vaginal infections (discussed later), another 
negative effect of vaginal microbiome disturbance is that bacteria can alter the innate immune response and barrier properties of the human vaginal epithelia in a species-spe-cific manner, requiring host epithelial cells to discriminate between commensal and pathogenic bacteria.
23 These 
interactions can lead to the development and progression of reproductive disease by disrupting the immune barrier.
pH
Vulvar pH could be expected to fall between values for the skin (estimated at pH 4.7)
24 and the vagina (average pH 
3.5),25 with reports ranging from 3.8 to 4.2 during the men-
strual cycle.26 Various factors may affect vulvar pH, 
including endogenous factors (e.g. humidity, sweat, vagi-nal discharge, menstruation, urine and fecal contamina-tion, anatomical folding, genetics, and age) and exogenous factors (e.g. soap, detergents, cosmetic products, lubri-cants and spermicides, occlusion with tight clothing or sanitary pads, shaving, and depilation products). Prolonged drying of the vulvar skin has been shown to significantly reduce its pH.
27 Vaginal pH correlates with total lactate 
concentration as the vaginal mucosa is a rich source of lac-tic acid, a by-product of estrogen-regulated anaerobic glu-cose metabolism.
28 Lactobacillus bacteria and other 
species also metabolize extracellular glycogen into lactic acid. The vaginal pH is therefore determined by the sum total of lactic acid production by the vaginal mucosa and microbial flora, but vaginal metabolism may have more influence than microbial metabolism.
28 Vaginal pH seems 
also to vary with ethnicity. For example, a study found that the vaginal pH of healthy reproductive-age Hispanic (pH 5.0
 ± 0.59) and Black (pH 4.7  ± 1.04) women was much 
less acidic than that of White (pH 4.2  ± 0.3) and Asian (pH 
4.4 ± 0.59) women, reflecting the higher prevalence of 
vaginal bacterial communities not dominated by Lactobacillus spp. in these two ethnic groups.
16
Vaginal discharge
For a year or two before puberty, until after menopause, it is normal and healthy for a woman to produce a vaginal discharge, consisting of bacteria and desquamated epithe-lial cells that slough from the vaginal walls together with mucus and fluid (plasma) produced by the cervix and vagina. The quantity and texture of this change during the menstrual cycle: vaginal discharge is thick, sticky, and hostile to sperm at the beginning and end of the menstrual cycle when estrogen is low and gets progressively clearer, watery, and more stretchy as estrogen levels rise prior to ovulation.
29,30
Protection from infections
The normal vaginal flora, acidic vaginal pH, and vaginal discharge are all components of the innate defense mecha-nisms that protect against vulvovaginal infections. Resident bacteria help maintain an acidic pH and compete with exogenous pathogens to adhere to the vaginal mucosa. They also fend off pathogens by producing antimicrobial compounds, such as bacteriocin. Vaginal fluids collected from five women showed in vitro activity against non-resi-dent bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and Group B Streptococcus.
31 Protection against Group B 
Streptococcus is particularly important for pregnant women as it often colonizes the vagina through the gastrointestinal tract and increases the risk of preterm delivery, neonatal meningitis, and even fetal death. It may also cause asymp-tomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infections, upper geni-tal tract infections, and postpartum endometritis.
In a study of pregnant women, elevated vaginal pH 
without current vaginal infection was significantly associ-ated with preterm birth,
32 posing obstetrical challenges. 
Elevated vaginal pH has also been associated with a 30% greater risk of infection with multiple human papillomavi-rus (HPV) types and with low-grade squamous intraepi-thelial lesions (LSILs) in a large population-based study.
33
Following menopause, and as estrogen levels fall, vagi-
nal pH increases,34 and this alkaline pH is associated with 
increased colonization with pathogenic microbes.28 Vulvar 
skin disorders are also more prevalent after the menopause.
The importance of vaginal lactic acid needs to be 
emphasized as it correlates with vaginal health, inhibits the growth of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis,
25 
and possibly plays a role in the local immune defense.35 
Vaginal epithelial cells also produce a range of compounds with antimicrobial activity (e.g. lysozyme and lactofer -
rin),
31 and rapid vaginal epithelium turnover serves as 
another defense mechanism.36 Recent research has also 
highlighted the important function of various factors in the innate and adaptive immunity of the female genital tract, including Toll-like receptors, surfactant protein A, com-plement system, β-defensins, and nitric oxide.
37–40
Common vulvovaginal disorders
Vulvovaginal infections
Vulvovaginal disease is often caused by multiple factors. 
Many factors, such as immune deficiency, hormonal changes, stress, or use of a vaginal douche or soap to clean the vagina, may upset the normal flora and cause infections.

The vulva is susceptible to dermatitis and other dermato-
logical conditions, particularly when the barrier function of the skin is compromised by factors that constitute the nor -
mal vulvar environment, namely, moisture (urine, vaginal dischar
ge), enzymes (stool residue), friction, and heat.41,42 
Signs and symptoms of vulvovaginal disorders are common (e.g. pruritus, pain and discomfort, changes in skin color and texture)
43 and can have significant impact on quality of life. 
Infections are often polymicrobial, with both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria involved.
Vulvovaginal candidiasis, characterized by an odorless, 
white, curdy discharge and local irritation, is most com-mon during the reproductive years.
44–46 The vulvar skin 
has an irregular or asymmetrical pattern, mild to intense erythema, edema of the labia minora, and possible edema of the labia majora. Triggers for symptomatic infection include pregnancy, poorly controlled diabetes, and recent antibiotic use. C. albicans, part of the normal flora, is the most common strain of Candida involved.
Bacterial vaginosis is the most frequent cause of abnor -
mal vaginal discharge among women of reproductive age and can arise and remit spontaneously.
47,48 It is an over -
growth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria found in the normal flora, including G. vaginalis, Prevotella spp., Mycoplasma hominis, and Mobiluncus spp., with a loss of normal Lactobacilli. Bacterial vaginosis is characterized 
by a white/gray homogeneous coating of the vaginal walls and vulva, with a fishy odor and vaginal pH >4.5. 
Recurrence can be a problem
49 due to the bacteria’s adap-
tive mechanism and normal vaginal flora not being re-established properly. In fact, as part of the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project, microbiome diversity was linked to the incidence of bacterial vaginosis, with African American women 2.9 times more likely to be diagnosed with bacte-rial vaginosis versus women of European ancestry, likely due to differences in their “normal” vaginal flora.
50 An 
extensive review confirmed that Lactobacilli-dominated molecular vaginal microbiota corresponded to a healthy vaginal microenvironment and that bacterial vaginosis should be described as a polybacterial dysbiosis (microbial imbalance)
51 where Lactobacillus load decreases and 
diversity and bacterial load of other anaerobic bacteria increases. Dysbiosis has been consistently associated  
with increased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HPV , herpes simplex virus–type 2 (HSV-2), and Trichomonas vaginalis infection.
15,51,52
Vulvovaginal itching and abnormal vaginal 
discharge
In qualitative interviews of 10 women with various vulvar 
skin conditions,53 itching was the most common and trou-
blesome symptom, leading to sleep disturbances and decreased quality of life. Itching can be caused by vaginal infections, such as vaginal trichomonas or vulvovaginal candidiasis, sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. HSV), and vulvar disorders (e.g. contact dermatitis, vulvar psoriasis, lichen sclerosus). Malodorous vaginal discharge is often associated with infectious (e.g. bacterial vaginosis, vulvar ulceration (infectious ulcerations such as herpes or tricho-monas or non-infectious ulcerations such as Behcet’s dis-ease or lichen planus that can become supra-infected with Staphylococcus), pelvic inflammatory disease, hidradeni-tis suppurativa) or non-infectious (e.g. excessive perspira-tion, urinary or fecal incontinence, poor hygiene) causes of vaginitis or vulvar disease.
Intimate feminine hygiene
Many factors contribute to feminine hygiene practices, including personal preference and cultural and societal influences. Although vaginal douching is common for many women, there are no known confirmed health bene-fits, and this may undermine the innate immune defenses by altering the normal vaginal flora and predisposing women to infections.
8,54,55  Vaginal douching has also been 
associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, and sexually transmitted infec-tions.
54 In contrast, routine washing of the vulva is desira-
ble to prevent accumulation of vaginal discharge, sweat, urine, and fecal contamination to prevent offensive body odor. Although vulvar cleansing may be a useful adjunct to medical treatment, vulvar cleansing products are not designed to treat infections. There has, however, been a surge in intimate hygiene products for cleanliness and odor control, but some may upset pH in the vulvovaginal area, which will affect the composition of the normal vulvovagi-nal microbiota needed for protection against infection.
56
Guidelines on feminine hygiene
The topic of intimate feminine hygiene has not received enough attention in the medical literature, thus making education a priority. In 2011, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) performed extensive literature searches to develop evidence-based guidelines intended for the general gynecologist for improving initial assessment and care of vulvar skin disor -
ders (Box 1).
57 Similarly, a committee from the Middle 
East and Central Asia (MECA) conducted extensive litera-ture searches to form recommendations on female genital hygiene (Box 2).
58 Both guidelines suggest daily vulva 
cleansing with a gentle hypoallergenic liquid wash.
Common practices around the world
Social, culture, and religious influences.  Differences in femi-
nine hygiene practices 
are related to differences in cultural 
beliefs and religious practices. Studies have found that Afro-Caribbean immigrants are more likely to wash the vulva with bubble bath or antiseptic than Caucasian women, and this is consistent with the belief that rigorous 
118962 Women’s Health 13(3) 
body cleansing is necessary for health and well-being.26 
Some Orthodox Jewish women perform ritual baths 
(mikveh) following their menstrual periods or after child-birth to become ritually pure, while the Muslim faith teaches a bathing ritual called full ablution (ghusl) for men and women as an act of purification after sexual inter-course or menstruation. In Mozambique and South Africa, some women internally cleanse their vaginas with lemon juice, salt water, or vinegar to eliminate vaginal discharge and “treat” sexually transmitted diseases.
59
The use of conventional panty liners (i.e. with a non-
breathable back sheet) is a widespread practice but can increase the temperature, skin surface moisture, and pH of the vulvar skin, thereby significantly changing the micro-climate of the vulva.
60
Extensive pubic hair removal, which was typically only 
done for cultural and religious reasons, has become more common for aesthetic reasons.
26,61,62  Hair removal may 
cause skin microtrauma and subsequent spread of infec-tious agents throughout the pubic area.
61 Severe conse-
quences may include vulvovaginal irritation and infection and spread of sexually transmitted infections (e.g. mollus-cum contagiosum and HSV).
63–65 In a recent study of pubic 
hair removal practices, over half of women reported removing all pubic hair and the majority experienced one or more complications due to removal.
63 Pubic hair serves Box 2.  MECA guidelines on female genital hygiene.58
• •Women of all ages require daily intimate hygiene to keep their genital area clean.
• •The vulva is susceptible to contact dermatitis. Take care to avoid contact with irritants.
• •Use a hypoallergenic liquid wash with mild detergency and pH 4.2 to 5.6.
• •Avoid bar soaps and bubble baths, which are abrasive and have a more alkaline pH.
• •Lactic acid–based liquids with an acidic pH may augment skin homeostasis and have been shown to be helpful in vaginal

• •Do not use talcum powder.
• •Use any perfumes and deodorants sparingly (after allergy testing).
• •Change tampons and sanitary pads frequently.
• •Before and after intercourse, cleanse the vulva from front to back, especially the clitoris and vulval folds.
• •Do not cleanse the vulva vigorously or irrigate the vagina.
• •Use a safe method of pubic hair removal and take care to avoid sensitivity and scarring.
• •Postpartum care should include frequent cleansing, drying, and using pads as necessary. Maintain dryness over any sutures. Do not use any creams.
• •Wash hands prior to children’s genital care. Use separate towels.
MECA: Middle East and Central Asia.Box 1.  RCOG guidance on care of vulvar skin.57
• •Most women with a vulvar disorder (e.g. contact dermatitis, vulvovaginitis) need advice about vulvar skin care and how to 
avoid contact irritants.
• •Washing with water can cause dry skin and make itching worse. Use a small amount of soap substitute and water to clean the vulva.
• •Shower rather than bathe and clean the vulva only once a day. Overcleaning can aggravate vulvar symptoms (e.g. symptoms of contact dermatitis). An emollient may be helpful.
• •Avoid using sponges or flannels. Just use your hand. Gently pat dry with a soft towel.
• •Wear loose-fitting silk or cotton underwear. Avoid close-fitting clothes. Wear loose-fitting trousers or skirts and replace tights with stockings. You may prefer to wear long skirts without underwear.
• •Sleep without underwear.
• •Avoid fabric conditioners and biological washing powders. Consider washing underwear separately in a non-biological  laundry detergent.
• •Avoid using soap, shower gel, scrubs, bubble bath, deodorant, baby wipes, or douches on the vulva.
• •Some over-the-counter creams, including baby or nappy creams, herbal creams (e.g. tea tree oil, aloe vera), and “thrush” treat-ments, may include irritants.
• •Avoid using panty liners or sanitary towels on a regular basis.
• •Avoid antiseptic (as a cream or added to bath water) in the vulvar area.
• •Wear white or light colored underwear. Dark textile dyes (black, navy) may cause an allergy, but if new underwear is laun-dered before use, it will be less likely to cause a problem.
• •Avoid using colored toilet paper.
• •Avoid wearing nail varnish on fingernails if you tend to scratch your skin.

Vulvovaginal products summar
y. Martin Hilber and col-
leagues66 investigated vaginal practices in Indonesia, 
Mozambique, South Africa, and Thailand and found that 
women used a range of products, from traditional herbal-type preparations (more common in African sites) to com-mercial products such as douches, soaps, and vaginal creams (more common in Asian sites). In a cross-sectional study of personal hygiene habits/practices in postmeno-pausal women, approximately half of women reported using at least one and one-third reported using at least two over-the-counter vulvovaginal treatments in the previous  
3 months (e.g. barrier treatments, topical anesthetics, pow-ders, antifungals).
67 Preclinical testing of 10 vaginal lubri-
cant products showed that seven had an acidic pH and three had a neutral pH; six of the products were hyper-osmolar, two were nearly iso-osmolar, and two were hypo-osmolar.
68 In a randomized placebo-controlled study of a 
vaginal topical pH-balanced gel in breast cancer survivors, the vaginal pH-balanced gel decreased vaginal pH and relieved vulvovaginal symptoms significantly better than the placebo gel.
69 A search on the latest vulvovaginal prod-
ucts launched in the past 3 years revealed that multiple for -
mats exist in the marketplace, including soaps, body washes, foam, premoistened wipes, powders, and deodor -
ant sprays. Key ingredients include lactic acid, glycerin, and a variety of natural extracts. These products claim to have efficacy in odor-neutralizing, moisturizing, or anti-bacterial activity (Table 2).Scientific support for a properly designed feminine wash.
  
Although common sense dictates that good feminine hygiene is desirable and healthy, no systematic trials have evaluated the health impact of vulvar hygiene. In a study 
of 500 women in Iran, poor menstrual and vaginal 
hygiene practices were significantly correlated with bac-terial vaginosis.
71 Anand et al.72 used data from a house-
hold survey and discovered that women who used unhygienic methods during menstruation (anything other than a sanitary pad or locally prepared napkin) were 1.04 times more likely to report symptoms of reproductive tract infections and 1.3 times more likely to have an abnormal vaginal discharge, including itching, vulvar irritation, lower abdomen pain, pains during urination or defecation, and low back pain. This highlights the need for safe and hygienic practices for women worldwide. In another study, women with vulvar use of bubble bath were twice as likely to have bacterial vaginosis than women who did not use this product, and bacterial vagi-nosis was three times more common in women using antiseptic solutions on the vulva or in the vagina and six times more common in women using a douching agent.
17 
Washing with water alone or with harsh surfactants can be abrasive, may impact the local flora, and could lead to dry skin and vulvar itching, thereby increasing the risk of infection. A recent in vitro study suggested that some vaginal products may be harmful to Lactobacillus bacte-ria and alter the vaginal immune environment and there-fore should be used with caution.
56
Since harsh soaps may irritate the vulvar skin and 
mucous membranes and provoke or exacerbate vulvar der -
matitis, feminine wash products should be formulated and tested specifically for the vulvar area to ensure that they do Table 2.  A summary of current feminine intimate hygiene products on the market.70

not cause skin irritation or sensitization. Bahamondes and 
colleagues73 demonstrated that using a lactic acid plus lac-
toserum liquid soap (~pH 4) for vulvar cleansing may help prevent bacterial vaginosis recurrence after oral metroni-dazole. In a large study during which women were asked to use feminine wash products containing natural plant extracts for 4 weeks, a positive clinical effect was shown favoring reduction of vaginal pH and improvement of symptoms and quality of sexual activity compared with pretreatment.
74,75 Another study demonstrated that a femi-
nine intimate hygiene deodorant spray with or without antibacterial components (0.01% or 0.02% chlorhexidine) did not significantly affect perivaginal microflora
11; how-
ever, the study was done before molecular identification techniques such as 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) microbi-ome sequencing and shotgun metagenomics became read-ily available.
Taken together, these data demonstrate the importance 
of appropriate female intimate hygiene using properly designed and tested products with key attributes including hypoallergenic, soap-free, pH friendly, mild cleanser, no irritants, protection against dryness, and maintenance of balanced microflora. In many cases, proper intimate femi-nine hygiene can help prevent or relieve the troublesome symptoms of itching and abnormal vaginal discharge and improve overall well-being.
Conclusion
Women regularly use intimate hygiene products as part of their daily cleansing routine. Currently, there are many dif-ferent intimate feminine hygiene products that may be used for cleanliness and/or odor control, but some can alter the normal pH level/microbiota needed for protection against infection. Although there is much published litera-ture on the internal vaginal environment, there is relatively limited information related to the external vulva and how intimate personal hygiene practices can affect it. Thus, education about the importance of, and potential risks associated with, female intimate hygiene is an important priority for both health care professionals and women to advance overall intimate health and hygiene.
Gentle vulvar cleansing is desirable, and evidence sug-
gests that it is an important aspect of female intimate hygiene and overall vulvovaginal health. Because of the risks associ-ated with internal washing/douching, external feminine washes are considered more appropriate for intimate health, particularly those containing lactic acid, with an acidic pH that augments skin homeostasis and may serve as a helpful adjunct therapy in women with vaginal infections or taking antibiotics. Vulvar cleansing may be a useful adjunct for women with odorous vaginal discharge, and daily use of a feminine wash may reduce the risk of recurrence of bacte-rial vaginosis. In addition, clinical practice guidelines rec-ommend women to use a pH-balanced hypoallergenic cleansing agent for daily vulvar cleansing. These external washes need to be carefully formulated for mild, gentle cleansing without impacting the natural flora, particularly in cultures where women may use these products frequently. It is also important for intimate feminine hygiene products to be assessed clinically to ensure that they are well tolerated and provide targeted antimicrobial and other health benefits without negatively impacting the natural vulvovaginal microbiota.
Future perspective
A properly designed feminine hygiene product should have targeted antimicrobial activity, mitigating transient pathogen invasion (such as Group B Streptococcus) while supporting the commensal flora. In light of the recent American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guideline
76 against vaginal seeding (a practice of 
transferring vaginal fluids to an infant born via cesarean delivery) due to lack of established safety and benefits, what is the future direction for restoring a cesarean-born baby’s skin microbiome? It will be interesting to observe whether start-up companies will find a better alternative to vaginal seeding using defined combinations of customized vaginal bacteria. Considering the increasing amount of research and data in the vulvovaginal microbiome field, should the future MECA and RCOG guidelines evolve to incorporate this very important aspect of vulvovaginal health? With the rapidly developing field of microbiome research, therapeutics, and diagnostics, we can expect to see more product offerings that will not only maintain the innate vulvovaginal microflora but also selectively boost the beneficial strains to enhance immunity against patho-genic infections.
Executive summary
• •There is little published in the medical literature about intimate feminine hygiene as it relates to external topical washes and the role intimate femi-nine hygiene plays in managing unpleasant symp-toms and supporting overall intimate health.
Physiology of the vulvovaginal area
• •The vulva is the first line of defense to protect the genital tract from infection.
• •Although knowledge about the microbial composi-tion of the external vulvar area is in its infancy, maintenance of the microbiota ratio is anticipated to play a key role in overall vulvovaginal health.
• •The normal vaginal flora, acidic vaginal pH, and vaginal discharge are all components of the innate defense mechanisms that protect against vulvovagi-nal infections.
1192Chen et al.  65
Vulvovaginal infections
• •Many factors, such as immune deficiency, hormo-
nal changes, stress, or use of a vaginal douche or soap to clean the vagina, may upset the normal flora and cause infections.
Intimate feminine hygiene
• •The topic of intimate feminine hygiene has not received enough attention in the medical literature, thus making education a priority.
• •Differences in feminine hygiene practices are related to differences in cultural beliefs and reli-gious practices.
• •Although common sense dictates that good femi-nine hygiene is desirable and healthy, no systematic trials have evaluated the health impact of vulvar hygiene.
• •Since harsh soaps may irritate the vulvar skin and mucous membranes and provoke or exacerbate vul-var dermatitis, feminine wash products should be formulated and tested specifically for the vulvar area to ensure that they do not cause skin irritation or sensitization.
• •Appropriate female intimate hygiene using properly designed and tested products with key attributes including hypoallergenic, soap-free, pH friendly, mild cleanser, no irritants, protection against dryness, and maintenance of balanced microflora is important.

ABSTRACT 
Intimate hygiene is an important health aspect of females in day-to-day life. The practices of intimate hygiene vary 
widely around the globe due to cultural and religious beliefs. Currently, professional recommen dations are limited in 
advising the optimal hygiene practices. Inappropriate practices can be concerning with the possibility of the 
development of infectious complications. Regular use of hygiene practices can improve overall health and boost self­
confidence in females. In this review, we provided our expert suggestions on the importance and standard practices that 
can be adopted by females worldwide for adequate and effective intimate hygiene.

INTRODUCTION 
Vulvovaginal health is one of the essential aspects to 
women's overall health. Improving vulvovag inal health is 
needed to enhance self-perception, self-confidence and 
intimacy. In addition, intimate hygiene is essential to 
remove the factors that create vulnerabilities for genital 
infection. Globally, current practices of intimate hygiene 
vary widely and many practices differ as per cultural and 
religious beliefs. Evidence indicates many Asian countries 
still cany negative connotations and consider it a taboo 
topic, especially in younger generatio ns. 1 
Optimal cleansing practices for the female intimate area is 
a long-standing debate. Majority of women are under­
informed or misinformed about appropriate female 
genitalia cleansing practices. Inappropriate hygiene 
practices can lead to untoward symptoms and may predispose to vulvovagina l infections . 2·3 Nonetheless , 
external cleaning and intimate feminine hygiene is 
essential for unpleasant symptoms and supporting overall 
mtunate health.4 There are limited professional 
recommendatio ns for intimate female hygiene practices 
globally.5,6 However, none are existing in the Indian 
setting. In this review, we provided expert practice points 
for appropriate use of intimate hygiene practices for Indian 
setting. 
Intimate hygiene-why? 
The external female genitalia include the mons pubis, labia 
majora and minora, clitoris and perineum. These outer 
genitalia support physiologica l, sexual and reproductive 
functioning. The genitalia are protected from pathogenic 
infection by a complementary array of defences including 
skin coverage and mucus production. The genital skin is

coated with a protective hydrolipid layer formed from 
sebum and sweat and is colonized by commensal bacteria 
and is buffered against injury by the hair cover. The 
physiology of the reproductive system is altered by steroid 
hormones produced during puberty, menstrual cycle, 
pregnancy, and menopause. The pH of the vagina 
fluctuates but is more acidic (pH 3.6 to 4.5) in women of 
reproductive age than in children or post-menopausal 
women.7-8 The acidic pH of the vulvovag inal region forms 
part of the innate chemical protection and a pH above 4.5 
in women of reproduct ive age is often associated with 
inflamma tory or infective conditions. Menstruation, 
pregnancy , and sexual intercourse can lead to changes in 
pH and have been associated with vulnerabi lity to 
infection.7 
Vaginal mucosa and intimate skin are colonized by varied 
bacteria flora. Some are commensal while others are 
transient. Lactobacilli are the major form of protective 
conunensa l bacteria in the vaginal mucosa and their 
growth is favored by high levels of estrogen. Lactobaci lli 
limit the colonization of transient and pathogen ic bacteria 
by producing antibacterial substances , hydrogen peroxide 
and lactic acid, which acidify the uppermost layers of the 
intimate skin.9 This causes the female genitalia to have a 
low pH, which provides both physical and chemical 
protection. The aim of intimate cleansing is to remove 
factors that can irritate or create vulnerabilities for genital 
infection. 
Care of vulva 
General measures 
Cleansing of the external intimate area should be 
conducted once or twice daily and never extend to the 
internal compartments of the genitalia. Women should 
wash their hands thoroughly before cleansing their 
intimate area. The ideal cleansing practice includes 
irrigation with clean water. The use of an intimate wash 
specially designed for the genital area is useful in special 
situations. More vigorous cleansing with wash­
cloths/loofahs have the potential to cause localized trauma 
and should be avoided. Cleansing must include the 
interlabial furrows between the labia minora and majora, 
and the clitoral prepuce. 
The area should be dried carefully using a clean, dry cotton 
towel/tissue. To prevent the potential transmission of 
infection, women should not share towels. Avoid wearing 
panty liners or sanitary towels on a regular basis. A void 
colored toilet/tissue paper. Antiseptic liquid should not be 
used for daily cleaning of the vulva. Wearing loose-fitting 
cotton or silk undergarments is recommended. White or 
light-colored underwear is preferable as dark textile dyes 
may cause allergies. At home, it is preferrab le to wear 
loose fitting clothes, and sleeping without undergarments. 
Fabric conditioners/antiseptic liquids are avoidable. Nails 
need to be kept trimmed. External wash 
The perineum and vulva are exposed to the external 
environment , and a non-soap cleanser/dedicated vulvar 
wash may be used. 
Soaps 
Bar soap is usually alkaline in nature or neutral. It may 
produce dryness and alter the skin pH, leading to an 
impaired skin barrier, making the vulva more prone to 
irritation and vulvitis, and should not be used for cleansing 
this delicate area. Avoid using soaps , shower gels, scrubs, 
bubble baths, deodorants as all of these may contain skin 
irritants. 
Liquid soaps and cleansing solutions 
Important ingredients in these soaps are lactic acid, 
glycerine , fatty acid salts that remove dirt from skin; Mild 
detergents help to dissolve grease and oils that are not 
easily removed with water alone whilst maintaining vulvar 
pH. Use of a specially designed, hypoallergic intimate 
wash is preferable . Liquid formulations are favoured as 
they avoid cross-contamination that can occur with soap 
bars. Intimate washes should ideally be slightly acidic (pH 
4.2 to 5.6). 
Non-soap cleansers 
These cleansers have a pH balance which is neutral to 
acidic, matching that of the vulvar area. They are non­
irritant, non-allergenic, and fragrance free. Lactic acid­
based cleansing solutions are recommended only for 
external use and not for vaginal douching. They can be 
used as adjuvant therapy for genital infection or 
inflammat ion but not as treatment. 
Wet wipes 
The wet wipes contain mild surfactant , preservatives, 
antimicrobials, and fragrance. They may occasionally 
cause allergic/irritant contact dermatitis. Colored tissue 
papers should be avoided. 
Odor control products 
Products like feminine deodorant sprays, body splashes, 
fragrances and feminine supposito ries are available. These 
have to be applied externally on or adjacent to female 
genitalia to absorb moisture, deodorize, neutralize or 
control odor. They may contain antimicrobial agents, 
astringents, and perfumes. There may be risks of irritation 
or sensitizat ion. 
Talcum powder 
Some women apply talcum powder on genital area to 
absorb moisture. Modem products marketed specifically 
for feminine hygiene have replaced talcum powder with 
International Journal of Reproduction , Contraception, Obstetrics and Gynecology Volume 11 · Issue 8 Page 2316 
1197Gandhi AB et al. Int J Reprod Contracept Obstet Gynecol. 2022 Aug;l 1 (8):2315-2319 
corn starch or baking soda. Some studies have suggested a 
slight increase in the risk of ovarian cancer with talcum 
powder use due to the talc which is contaminated with 
asbestos.10•11 Hence, should be avoided. 
Vaginal douching 
Regular douching practices may vary between women in 
different countries. It is the process of introducing liquids 
into the vagina for the purpose of cleansing. Homemade 
solutions such as water and vinegar are sometimes used. 
All such practices should be avoided. Vaginal douching 
can lead to PID, cervical carcinoma , increased chances of 
contracting STI including HIV infection and bacterial 
vaginosis, preterm delivery etc.12 Hence it is not advisable 
for the purpose of feminine hygiene. Vaginal douching 
should only be used in clinical settings. 
Clothing 
Nylon underwea r, tight fitting garments etc. can increase 
local friction, heat and moisture. Bacteria and yeast thrive 
in moist or damp places. Hence cotton underwear is 
preferred over synthetic materials as cotton is breathable 
and allows air to circulate around the external genitalia. 
Women who sweat easily or exercise should change damp 
clothes often. After bathing, the external genital area 
should be dried very gently with a soft towel without 
rubbing. Sleeping without underwear is preferable . 
Traditional Indian wear like sarees, skins, pett.icoats, 
salwar are more "genital-friendly". 
Specific recommendations for key life stages 
Hygiene in childhood 
The Caretaker should wash his/her hands before handling 
the child. The genitalia of the baby should be washed 
carefully with warm water from front to rear. After 
washing, the perineum , and buttocks should be carefi11ly 
wiped with a clean, soft towel. This towel should not be 
shared by any other person. 
Menstrual care 
A daily bath is essential for cleanliness especially during 
menstruat ion. The genital area can be washed and dried in­
bet\veen the pad changes. Sanitary pads are worn 
externally, and tampons and menstrnal cups are used 
internally. Cotton sanita1y napkins produce less skin 
irritation. Sanitary pads should be changed frequently 
(every 6 to 8 hourly-more frequently if required) 
depending upon the amount of bleeding. Used pads should 
not be flushed in the toilet but should be wrapped in 
wastepaper and thrown in the special covered dust bins. 
Recently, menstrnal cups made up of silicone are available 
for use during menstruat ion. 
Disposal of single-use sanita1y napkins creates a big 
problem to the environment. These may seem expensive to some. Hence reusable napkins made up of soft cotton 
cloth is a good alternative. They can be washed w ith soap 
and water and dried in the sun. This way they can be reused 
multiple times. Biodegradable sanitary napkins made up of 
bamboo shoots is a new addition to the basket. Period 
panties are the latest addition for menstrnal care. These 
have the ability to soak and retain accumulated blood 
without leakage and can also be washed and re-used. 
Women and girls should consult their Gynecologist to get 
more information regarding these different protective 
devices to keep themselves clean and hygienic avoiding 
infection. 
Menstrual cups: use during period 
Since silicone cups are bacteria resistant, they don't need 
to be washed eve1y time they are emptied. Simply rinsing 
it in the sink is enough to clean it out before reinserting. 
Initial rinse with cold water, followed up with a hot rinse 
is sufficient to disinfect it. 
Menstrual cup: care between periods 
Boil 3 cups of clean water on the stove. Submerge cup but 
make sure the cup isn't touching the bottom or sides of the 
pot. Boil for 5-8 minutes then drain the cup and let it air 
d1y. 
Storing menstrua l cups 11'hen not in use 
Most cups will come with a bag or pouch to store it in when 
not in use. If it did not come with one, any breathable 
pouch can be used. The cup needs to be protected from dirt 
and germs but should still have plenty of air circulation. 
Store the pouch in a cold, d1y location (such as a vanity 
drawer) where the cup can properly dry out before your 
next use.13 
Pre-coital care 
During sexual intercourse , transm1ss10n of bacteria, 
secretions , sweat, menstrual blood, urine and fecal waste 
can occur from the external environment into the vaginal 
canal. Cleaning of the external genitalia should include the 
vulva, as well as the folds of the labia and the clitoris 
before coitus. Hands and nails should be kept clean and 
neatly cut for a safe sex play. Perfumes/ deodorants should 
not be used directly on skin before intercourse as they can 
cause allergic reactions. 
Post-coital care 
The perineum and vulva should be cleansed off secretions 
from front to back with clean water. Post coital douche is 
not recommended for fear of ascending vaginal infection. 
Disinfectants should be avoided. Passing urine after coitus 
reduces the incidence of urinary tract infections.

Care during pregnancy 
Pregnant women are more susceptible to genital infections 
due to hormonal and immune system alterations. Regular 
cleaning of external genital organs with warm water and 
cleansers containing lactic acid is advisable. These 
cleansers maintain a physiological pH. They also enhance 
the skin's natural barriers. As they are non-teratogenic, 
they can be safely used in pregnancy. Use of a plain 
unperfi.uned intimate wash for the vulva or the outer part 
of tl1e vaginal region is recommended. Avoid using a 
vaginal douche or washing the vaginal area with regular 
soaps and gels or heavily perfumed one -this wreaks havoc 
with the pH balance and good bacteria that keep the vagina 
healthy making one more susceptible to infections. The 
intimate wash for pregnant women must not contain strong 
perfumes and chemicals that could irritate the skin and 
affect the pH balance of the vagina and should be paraben 
and irritant-free. 
Postpartum perinea! care 
Washing hands before and after each perinea! care is 
recommended. The soiled pad should be removed from 
front to back and discarded in the waste container. Squeeze 
peri bottle (fill the bottle with cleaning warm water) or 
pour warm water or cleansing solution over perineum 
without opening labia. Ensure that the solution flow is 
from the front to the back. Dry the perinea! area with dry 
tissue from front to back, and then discard it. Apply 
medicated spray, ointment or pad as directed. Do not apply 
perinea! pad for one to two minutes (otherwise medication 
will be observed in pad). Apply the clean perinea! pad from 
front to back, touching only sides and outsides of the pad 
to lessen the risk of infection. Do not flush the toilet until 
standing upright, othe1wise , the flushing water can spray 
onto the perineum. Always perform perinea! care after 
elimination (urination or defecation) or at least every 4 
hours during Puerperium. Start at the front (area just under 
the symphysis pubis) and proceed towards the back 
(around the anus) to prevent contaminations from the anal 
area. The perinea! pad should be changed regularly to 
prevent infection. If edema is present, apply perinea! ice 
packs intermittently for the first 24 hours after birth. The 
ice pack should remain in place approximately 20 minutes 
and then removed for about 10 minutes before being 
replaced.14 
Hygiene for post-menopausal and older women 
After menopause , estrogen levels go down significantly 
leading to less glycogen content in vaginal epithelial cells 
which in mm lowers Doderlein's bacilli. Due to less 
production of lactic acid, the pH increases, predispos ing to 
infection. Menopausa l women have vulvovag inal atrophy 
predisposing to irritation and itching. Washing the intimate 
area with a good vulvar wash containing lactic acid is 
useful and gives a soothing effect. Postmenopau sal women 
suffer urogenital symptoms such as vaginal d1yness in 
32%, prnritus vulvae in 10-17%, and dyspareunia and urinary urgency in 10%. Vaginal lubricants can be 
recommended for the symptomatic improvement of 
dyspareunia. Vaginal moisturizers can be offered for 
vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. Local estrogen therapy 
(ET) is the first line of management , the only 
contraind ication being active estrogen dependent tumors. 
Lifestyle modification , bladder drill, and pelvic floor 
exercises are recommended for urinary incontinence.15 
Mons pubis hair care-hair removal products 
Vulvar hair removal is not a recommendation for vulvar 
hygiene. If the patient still desires it, one can consider 
options such as trimming with clippers, shaving, waxing, 
electrolysis, and laser hair reduction. Trimming, clipping, 
and shaving have few adverse effects as long as they are 
done carefully. The hair can be trimmed to few mms in 
length with a pair of scissors or electric trimmers. A razor 
trims hairs to the skin surface. A wet shave is 
recommended , using a non-soap cleanser, or a shaving gel. 
Care to not cut/nick the skin. Waxing is a process in which 
a sticky viscous material is applied, and then pulled off 
with the help of a cloth or synthetic material with a quick 
pull opposite to the direction of growth. The process is 
painful, and folliculitis is a complicat ion to watch out for. 
Various lasers are available for hair reduction (Diode/Q­
switched Nd:YAG / IPL) The laser light targets the dermal 
papilla and the hair bulge. Burns, post-inflammatory 
hyper/hypo pigmentation are complications with untrained 
technicians. Multiple treatment s are required to achieve a 
significant hair reduction of the area. Adverse effects of 
laser hair removal include blistering and burning of the 
skin with post-inflammatory hypo or hyperpigmen tation. 
Electrolysis uses an electric current to destroy the hair root. 
Each hair is treated with either a needle epilator or a 
tweezers epilator. Adverse effects of electrolysis ca11 
include pain during treatment and scarring. This method 
has lost popularity in view of the availability of better and 
faster, less-painful options. 
Expert practice points 
Daily intimate hygiene is necessary for women of all ages 
in order to maintain general health. The delicate vulvo­
vaginal skin and mucosa should not be exposed to 
environmental 1rntants or unsuitable hygiene 
products.When using a liquid cleanser, it should be a mild 
non-soap cleanser with an acidic pH between 4.2 to 5.6. 
Traditional bar soaps and bubble baths should be avoided 
due to their high alkaline pH and abrasive properties. 
Lactic acid-based liquids have been shown to improve skin 
homeostasis and can be used as an adjuvant therapy in 
specific conditions like infections and irritation. Vaginal 
douching is not recommended at any age due to its 
association with vaginitis and PID. Loose fitting 
undergarments made of natural materials like cotton and 
silk are recommended. Prolonged use of tight clothes is 
discouraged to avoid frictional damage and skin 
maceration of the genital area due to the lack of proper 
ventilation. Perfumes and deodorants should be best

avoided. Menstrual care should include the use of 
reusable/disposable sanitary pads. Frequent changing is 
recommended. Use of menstmal cup or period panties is 
environmen tally friendly. Gentle pre and post coital 
cleansing of the genital area especially the clitoris and the 
vulvar folds, from front to back is recommended with 
clean water. Removal of pubic hair is not essential for 
genital hygiene, but when practiced , should be based on 
safe and hygienic techniques. Trimming or clipping is 
preferred. Postpa11Um care should include frequent 
cleansing, drying and use of cotton pads as necessary. 
Dryness should be maintained over any sutures. Infant 
genital care requires the caretaker to wash his/her hands 
beforehand and use separate towels for children. The vulva 
and vagina are commonly affected areas for contact 
dermatitis and should be kept away from environmental 
irritants or certain hygiene products. Repeated and 
vigorous vulvar cleansing should be avoided. Patients 
experienc ing symptoms of itching, burning, discharge, 
unpleasan t odor should seek help from a vulvar specialist. 
COl\'CLUSIO:'.\' 
It is emphasized that vulva is the first line of defense 
against genital tract infections. However, intimate hygiene 
is not currently practiced widely in the Indian setting. As 
intimate hygiene is desirable for overall good health in 
women, practices may vary significantly because of 
cultural and religious practices. It is important to educate 
women about intimate hygiene and the use of appropriate 
products that can cause no harm and would not affect the 
microbial microflora. We strongly recommend following 
safe intimate hygiene practices for all Indian women.

ABSTRACT 
Introduction: Genital hygiene is an important part of women's health and is essential for protecting reproductive 
health. Women adopt many genital hygiene behaviors, which will have direct and indirect effects on genitals and 
possible sexually transmitted infections . This systematic literature review aimed to know the types of genital hygiene 
behaviors practiced by women and assess the relationship between genital hygiene behavior and genital infection. 
Methods: A systematic search of the electronic databases , PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect,JSTOR, 
and SAGE, for literature published betweenjanuary2001 and 2021. The keywords used were "genital hygiene behavior" 
AND "genital infections" AND "women OR female." The inclusion criteria focused on genital hygiene behavior and the 
incidence of genital infection . The included full papers with observational research methods followed the PRISMA 
guidelines. After reading the full content of the included studies, key themes and concepts were extracted and 
synthesized . 
Results: In total 383 articles were screened . Five articles met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed . The analysis 
revealed four categories related to genital hygiene behavior among women: underwear hygiene, bathing habits, 
menstrual hygiene, and coital hygiene. Genital infections included bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal 
candidiasis. The review showed that incorrect and inadequate genital hygiene behavior increases the risk of vaginal 
infection . 
Conclusion: A higher incidence of genital infections occurred in women with improper genital hygiene practices . It is 
necessary for health professionals to educate women about good genital hygiene practices in order to reduce the rate of 
genital infections. 
Keywords : genital hygiene behaviors: genital infection: systematic review: women's health 
Introduction 
Genital hygiene plays a key role in preventing genital 
infections . Early identification of genital infections, 
appropriat e treatment measures, and necessary 
preventive measures are essential to protect and improve 
women's health (Hamed, 1QW. Genital infection is a 
serious female health problem, which is related to a 
negative impact on sexual and family life (Sevil et al., 
1Q.ll}. In this case, genital infection has become a serious 
public health problem, which is common in both 
developed and developing countries . About 1 million women around the world suffer from genitourinary 
system infections, such as urinary tract infections and 
bacterial vaginosis, and 75% of them have had genital 
infections . The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) has 
been found to be 8%-75%, the prevalence of vulvar 
vaginal candidiasis (vvc) is 2.2%-30%, and the 
prcvalenceoftrichomoniasis (YT) is 0%-34% (Karadeniz, 
1Q.12). More than one million Sexually Transmitted 
Infections (STls) are spread worldwide every day (World 
Health Organization, ~-
The factors that cause female genital infections vary 
widely. The closeness of the urethra, vagina, and anus to

each other is the most important factor in the 
susceptibility to genital infection, and certain factors will 
increase the risk of its occurrence (Calik et al., lQ.2.Q.). The 
understanding of reproductive health issues varies 
greatly among countries, societies, and individuals . 
Socioeconomic status, race, religious belief, and 
education level all affect women's views and behaviors on 
reproductive health. In particular, feminine hygiene 
habits are different among women with a high prevalence 
of behavioral defects, and these behavioral defects easily 
make them susceptible to vulvovag initis (Attieh et al., 
.N!§). Genital infections do not always threaten women's 
lives, but their symptoms can lead to serious illnesses 
(Hilber, Francis, et al., Mll.Q). These infections can lead to 
ectopic pregnancy, sepsis, cervical cancer, infertility and 
congenital infections of the newborn (Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, ~-
Care and treatment of women's vagina and genitals 
can reduce their susceptibility to sexually transmitted 
infections (STls) and other sexual and reproductive 
diseases (Myer et al., 2005). A qualitative study has linked 
women's intravaginal practices and sexuality, and 
demonstrates that women in the four countries . 
Indonesia, Mozambique, South Africa, and Thailand, 
actively use a variety of practices to achieve a desired 
vaginal state. Moreover, that study discusses types of 
vaginal practices, products used in vaginal practices and 
health consequences arising from these practices (Hilber, 
Hull, et al., Mll.Q). 
The data obtained indicated that the prevalence rate 
of BV is relatively high and could be influenced by hygiene 
ITT Records identified through database

Title screening (n = 366) 
Abstract screening (n = 20 I) behavior and certain socio-demographic characteristics, 
which indicated that genital behavior needs attention 
(Bahram et al., lQQ2.). Behavioral factors such as vaginal 
douching or menstrual hygiene practices have been 
suggested as important factors that might influence 
vaginal infections (Cottrell, 2001; Cottrell & Close, 2008; 
Ott et al., 2009). Differences in vaginal practices, 
exposure measurements, study design, study 
populations, and statistical analysis definitions and 
classifications can explain these conflicting results 
(Brown & Brown, 2000; Hilber, Francis, et al., 2010; 
Hilber, Hull, et al., Mll.Q). Various personal hygiene 
methods can be very harmful to health (9). In this case, 
unhealthy and dangerous practices can be attributed to 
improper cleaning of the genital area after using the toilet 
and poor handwashing habits. Frequent genital cleaning, 
lack of adequate underwear, insufficient attention to 
menstrual hygiene, sterile childbirth or artificial abortion 
as a method of family planning can increase the risk of 
genital infections (Felix et al., 2020; Karadeniz, ~. 
To get a contextu al understanding of the genital 
hygiene behavior needed to be carried out by women, a 
simple brief information sheet and knowledge of what 
behaviors need to be considered is needed. Although 
there are a few studies on women's specific hygiene 
habits in the United States, Egypt and Turkey and other 
countries, they arc still rare (Attieh et al, 1Q!.Q}. 
Information about the literature review toward genital 
hygiene behavior is lacking. Therefore, we conducted the 
current study with a systematic literature review with the 
following objectives: (1) to determine what types of

Materials and Methods 
Search Strategy 
The primary question guiding this review was: "How 
does OSS enhance physical activity among adolescents?" 
Meanwhile, the secondary question was: "What arc the 
characteristics of OSS utilised to enhance physical 
activity among adolescents?" The present systematic 
review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 
flow diagram guidelines (Moher et al., 2.Ql,). The authors 
searched electronic databases for literature published 
between 2001 and January 2021, only articles published 
in English were considered . A high-sensitivity search 
strategy was used to search the following databases: 
PubMed; Ovid; Web of Science; Scopus; ScienceDirect; 
JSTOR and SAGE. Relevant articles, which included the 
search term (genital hygiene behavior) AND (genital 
infections OR Sexually Transmitted Infections) AND 
(women OR female) in the title, were identified. 
Keywords were combined with the Boolean operator 
AND to limit the searches . An overview of the search 
terms can be found in Table 1. 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. 
The inclusion criteria were full paper articles with 
observational research methods. The exposure given was 
genital hygiene behavior, the research subjects were 
Table I Overview of the search terms Jurnal Nm 
women with genital infection . The exclusion criteria in 
this study were non-observation al studies, female 
populations under 15 years, the articles were not full text 
and were not published in English. 
Operational Definitio n of Variable 
A Genital hygiene behavior: a behavior or method of 
individual care to maintain cleanliness and health of their 
reproductive organs to achieve physical and 
psychological well-being . Genital hygienic practices 
include external washing, intra-vaginal cleansing, pre­
and post-coital care, menstru al hygiene, and external 
application . 
Genital infections can be caused by bacteria, fungi, 
parasites, or viruses growing in and around vagina and 
vulva (the area surrounding the vagina). Symptoms are 
such as soreness, itchiness, and an unusual vaginal 
discharge . Common types of vaginal infections are yeast 
infections, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis, a 
sexually transmitted infection. 
Procedure 
The studies were assessed according to the eligibility 
criteria and the selection process was divided into two 
phases. Data were managed by transferring references to 
a reference management tool (Mendeley) . For further 
documentation the Review Manager, Covidence.org (The 
Cochrane Collaboration, Melbourne,Ausuali a), was used 
(Helfer et al., 2015). Documentation of the selection 
process was done with management tools. As a first step, 
the duplicates from the initial search results were 
removed. The initial search results were filtered by title

screening process, the full text that met the requirements 
was analyzed. Playback of the title, abstract, and full text 
were reviewed. If no full text was avaiJable, the article was 
excluded. The process was tracked in flow diagram 
according to PRISMA (Figure 1). 
Quality Assessment 
The authors independently rated the methodological 
quality of selected studies using the Critical Review 
Forms which, developed by canChild (McMaster 
University, Canada), is a tool for conducting critical 
reviews of outcome measures and journal articles (Law ct 
al., 1998a, 1998b). The quality of the studies was assessed 
with several questions with the answers "yes/ no / not 
addressed " according to the criteria of the CanChild 
Critical Review Form (Law ct al., ~ ~-After 
careful analysis of the quality related to results, the 
articles containing the highest quality and content for the 
work were included. The quality assessment of the 
studies can be found in Table 2. One researcher undertook 
this assessment independently , with a random 10% of the 
articles reviewed by a second researcher. There were no 
discrepancies in the application of the risk of bias 
assessment found when the random sample of articles 
was compared by a second reviewer. 
Data Analysis 
This systematic review adopted thematic synthesis. 
The five studies were read thoroughly to identify critical 
points and themes. We found the theme1 which was type 
of genital hygiene behavior commonly practiced by 
women, and subtheme, which was underwear hygiene, 
bathing habits, menstrual hygiene and coital hygiene. For 
the analysis of the themes, we followed the Braun and 
Clark approach (Braun and Clarke, 2006). The first phase, 
familiarization, entails the reading and re-reading of the 
entire dataset. This is necessary to be able to identify 
appropriate information that may be relevant to the 
research question. In the second phase, we did the coding 
on the subthcmcs found. The coding process was 
performed to produce concise descriptive or interpretive 
labels that may be relevant to the research question. 
Phase three was generating themes, namely the type of 
genital hygiene behavior comrr.on ly practiced by women. 
Phase four reviewed potential themes, wherein we did 
not find any other potential themes. Phase five was 
defining and naming the theme while phase six involved 
producing the report in which we wrote and reponed the 
findings from a review of the analyzed articles (Table 3). 
The papers were synthesized under the following 
subheadings: Author, research aims, design and data 
collection, sample number and characteristics, type of 
genital hygiene behavior, type of genital infection1 and 
research findings (Aoocndix 1). Independent reviewers 
extracted the data related to genital hygiene behavior

Results 
The search identified 383 publications. After 
duplicates were excluded (n = 17), a total of 366 
publicat.ions was identified according to the search 
strategy. Some irrelevant titles were excluded (n = 165) 
and 185 abstracts did not meet the criteria, so they needed 
to be excluded. Examples of articles that did not meet the 
following criteria were not available in full text, use a 
language other than English, and not quantitative 
research. The full text was obtained for the remaining 16 
ankles which were eligible. After a detailed review1 only 
five articles were found to meet the inclusion criteria and 
were selected for analysis. Of the eleven excluded articles, 
two had inappropriate study designs and the others had 
irrelevant topics. Sec Figure I for the selection process

Description of Study 
A total of five studies were included in the review. The 
studies consisted of four cross-sectional studies1 and one 
case-control study. The total sample analyzed was 2,233 
respondents, from women aged 15 years to more than 60 
years. The target population was students, married 
women, and non-pregn ant women1 as well as female 
patients undergoing treatment at the gynecology 
department. The studies were conducte d in Turkey with 
the number of sample 1,057 female students with the 
mean age of 21.03 ot 1.70 years and another study from 
Turkey showed 266 married women, the mean age of 38.S 
"' 7.9 (min = 20, max = 49); in Iran 500 non-pregnant 
women aged between IS and 45 (mean age 36years) were 
enrolled; in Ethiopia the respondents were 210 female 
patients aged between IS and 64 years, and the last study 
conducted in Egypt was a case control study with a total 
200 women. A study conducted by Bahram (2009) 
showed that 16.2% of women experienced BV, 6.6% VT, 
and 4.8% VVC. Meanwhile, Bitew ct al.'s study (1Q!Z) 
showed that 48.6% of women experienced BV and 51.4% 
did not experience. 
Type of Genital Hygiene and Genital Infections 
Eight Most of the data collection techniques were 
carried out by questionnaires to assess genital hygiene 
behavior. It was found that several types of genital 
hygiene behavior were carried out by women, specifically 
underwear hygiene, bathing habits, menstrua l hygiene, 
1204and coital hygiene practices (Appendix 1). In addition, to 
determine genital infection , women had a history of 
genital infection that had been diagnosed by a physician 
with a genital infection within the past six months 
(Hamed, ~ $evil et al.,~-A diagnosis was made to 
determine genital infection through a Pap smear test 
(Calik et al., 2020) and specimen collection for genital 
infection culture (Bahram et al., 2009; Bitew et al., Mli.Z). 
Genital infectious diseases obtained from the review 
were bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and 
vulvovaginal candidiasis (Bahram et al., 2009; Bitew et 
al., 1Q!1) (Appendix I}. Some studies did not explain in 
detail the types of genital infections suffered by women, 
they only explained that women had experienced genital 
infections (but did not specify what type of disease) (Sevil 
ct al., NU) and the symptoms experienced by women, 
such as pathological vaginal discharge (Calik et al., 2020) 
and vaginal infections (Hamed. N1l}. 
Outcomes 
From the five studies, four themes related to genital 
hygiene behavior were identified: underwear hygiene, 
bathing habits, menstrual hygiene, and coital hygiene. 
Meanwhile, three types of genital infections were 
identified based on data obtained from respondent s: 
bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and vulvovag inal 
candidiasis (Appendix 1). 
Sevil et al. (l,QQ) examined the relationship between 
genital hygiene practices and genital infections in a group 
of university students, including 1057 female students 
aged between 17 and 27 years old. This study used a 
questionnaire developed in line with the purpose of the 
study to evaluate the relationship between genital 
hygiene practices and genital infection in a group of 
university students. 
Some of the questions that respondents were asked 
about genital hygiene were (a) underwear hygiene and 
bathing habits, which consisted of five questions 
including the type of underwear used (hosiery/co tton, 
satin/flannel), the frequency of changing underwear 
(once a week, twice-three times a week, daily),dail ypads 
(yes, none), bathing position (standing, sitting, 
sometimes sitting, sometimes standing), bathing 
frequency (daily/once every 2-3 days, weekly/once every 
fifteen days); (b) the toilet hygiene practice had six 
questions, which were genital area cleaning, type of 
genital area cleaning, agent used for genital area cleaning 
(water, soaps, cosmetics), drying genital area, material 
used for drying the genital area (toilet roll, cloth}, 
frequency of cleaning genital hair, hand washing; (c) 
menstrual hygiene, consisting four questions, including 
the materials used during menstruation (pad, cloth), the 
frequency of changing materials during menstruation 
(per day}, bathing during menstruation (yes, no} and the 
use of perfume for unpleasant odors during 
menstruation . Students who were diagnosed with genital Jurnal Nm 
infections by a physician in the past six months were 
considered "students with a history of genital infections." 
Of the 1,057 female students included in this study, there 
were 137 (13.0%) who had a history of genital infections. 
An assessmen t of underwear and bathing habits of 
students with genital infection history did not 
demonstrate any relationships between the frequency of 
changing underwear and infection history (x:2 = 5.404; p 
= 0.067). The frequency of genital infections was higher 
among those who used hosiery/cotton underwear and 
daily pads (x2 = 5.602; p = 0.018 and X2 = 8.490; p = 
0.004, respectively). History of genital infections was 
significantly more common among those who bathed in 
the sitting position and in those who bathed once a week 
(x2 = 49.570; p < 0.001 and X2 = 25.534; p < 0.001, 
respective ly}. 
Genital infection was significantly less common 
among those who told that they practiced genital 
cleaning (x2 = 62.263; p < 0.001), while they were more 
common among those who described that they cleaned 
the genitals randomly (X2 = 14.350; p = 0.001), used soap 
(x2 = l0.170; p = 0.004}, did not dry the genital area (x2 = 
48.657; p < 0.001), used cloth for drying (x2 = 30.006; p < 
0.001), performed frequent genital area cleaning with 
materials such as razor (x2 = 15.918; p < 0.001) and did not 
always pay attention to hand washing (X2 = 12.733; p = 
0.002). The frequenc y of genital infections was 
significantly higher among those who used cloth and 
those who did not bathe during menstruation (X2 = 
46.042; p < 0.001 and X2 = 8.984; p = 0.003, respectivel y}. 
The cross-sectional study by Bahram et al. (2009} 
included 500 non-pregnant women between the ages of 
15 and 45 years. This study aimed to determine the 
prevalence of BV and the effects of sexual and genital 
hygiene practices and sociodemographic in non­
pregnant women. To diagnose BV, vaginal swabs were 
heat-fixed, gram-stained and examined with an oil 
immersion objective (l000x magnification) and analyzed 
according to the standardized quantitative 
morphologica l classification method of Nugent. The 
diagnosis of vulvar vaginal candidiasis has been 
suggested in women who presented with symptoms 
and/or signs of vaginitis, e.g., vaginal discharge, itching, 
external dysuria, and vulvovaginal erythema . 
Trichomoniasis was diagnosed by visualizing mobile 
trichomonads in the wet dissection smear immediately 
after sampling . All laboratory evaluations were carried 
out by microbiologists . 
The questions on genital hygiene were (a) menstrua l 
hygiene (bathing during menstruation, genital douching 
during menstruation , use of sanitary napkins, changing 
sanitary napkins after each urination, sexual abstinence 
during menstruation); (b) individual vaginal hygiene 
(regular underwea r changing, underwear washing with 
hot water, use of loose underwear , ironing underwear, 
front-to-back cleaning of genitalia, use of private

bathroom, personal bathroom amenities, bathroom 
hygiene, sun drying bathroom amenities, shaving genital 
hair); (c) hygiene during intercourse (genital douching 
before intercourse, urination after intercourse, frequency 
of intercourse) . 
The prevalence of RTls was 27.6%, including 16.2% for 
BV, 6.6% for VT, and 4.8% for VVC. There was a significant 
correlation between menstrual and individual vaginal 
hygiene and BV (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001). in contrast to 
coital hygiene, no significant correlation was observed 
between BV and coital hygiene. The data obtained 
suggest that the prevalence rate of BV is relatively high 
and could be influenced by hygienic behaviors and 
certain socio-demographic characteristics. 
Bitew et al. {2017) conducted a cross-sectional study 
among 210 patients to assess the relationship between 
the prevalence of BV and genital hygiene behavior . Gram­
stained vaginal swabs were examined microscopically 
and sorted by the Nugent method; Bacteria causing 
aerobic vaginitis were characterized and their 
antimicrobial susceptibility pattern determined. 
Questionnaires on genital hygiene behavior included 
the number of pants worn daily (1-2 pants/day, one pants 
for 2-4 days); frequency of vaginal baths/day (1-3, e,4). 
The overall prevalence of BV was 48.6%. The prevalence 
of BV was lower among patients who changed pants more 
frequently (two per day) than among those who changed 
their pants less frequently (one pants for 2-4 days) (AOR 
= 0.367; 95% Cl= 0.201 to 0.672; p = 0.001). Patients who 
bathed their vaginal region more frequently were less 
affected than those who did not bathe their vaginal area 
as much (AOR = 1.847; 95% Cl= 1.013 to 3.370; p = 0.045). 
This study found that the prevalence of BV was high and 
was affected by individual hygiene. 
A cross-sectional study byCalik ct al. (2020) recruited 
66 married women aged 20 to 49 years. The data were 
collected using a questionnaire, the Genital Hygiene 
Behavior Inventory (GHBI), a gynecological examination 
and the Pap smear test. A specialist performed a Pap 
smear for the gynecological examination of the women 
and the results were recorded by the researcher after 20 
days. 
This study used a questionnaire in the form of GHBI 
and with a four-level item, and was developed by Ege and 
Ery1lmaz (2005) to determine the genital behaviors of 
women aged between 15 and 49 years of age. The 
inventory was single-dimensional and included 24 
positive and three negative items, consisted of three 
subdimensions including "general hygiene," "menstrua l 
hygiene", and "abnormal finding awareness ." Each item 
contained the alternative answer "never", "sometimes", 
"frequently", and "always". In the inventory, the lowest 
and highest total points were 27 and 108 points, 
respectively . The high total points indicated good 
behavior in term of genital hygiene. 
Of the women who reported having vaginal discharge 
(54.9%), 45.1% had abnormal discharge and odor (34.6%) 
94 P-IIIN: 1858-3598 • E-155N: llOl-5791 and burning sensation (35%); speculum examination 
showed that 42.6% had a pathological discharge and the 
incidence of genital infections in vaginal cytology was 
79%. lt was found that 71.4% of women had pathological 
or non-pathological discharge ; the mean GHBI score for 
women was 70.27 ± 10.05. It was found that the average 
GHBI value for women was slightly above the moderate 
value and that improper genital hygiene practices 
increased the risk of vaginal infection in women. At the 
same time, a significant relationship was found between 
genital discharge complaints and GHBI score hygiene 
behaviors (p = 0.009). 
Hamed ~), in his case-control study, evaluated 
the impact of genital hygiene practices on the incidence 
of vaginal infections and developed a care factsheet as a 
prevention message for women at risk, and not pregnant . 
Case group: women diagnosed with vaginal infection (n = 
100). Control group: women without vaginal infection (n 
= 100). 
Respondents were asked to complete a genital 
hygiene behavior questionnaire, which consisted of the 
following questions: (a) genital hygiene practices (type of 
underwear, frequency of underwear changes, external 
washing of the genital area, daily use of pads, drying after 
going to the toilet; (b} menstrual hygiene practices 
(bathing during menstruation, hand washing before and 
after using the toilet, type of material used during 
menstruation, frequency of changing pads, procedures 
for treating dirty sanitary pads); (c) sexual intercourse 
hygiene practices (genital care before intercourse, genital 
care after intercourse, use of local contraceptives, use of 
chemicals and lubricants during intercourse, use of 
douching after intercourse). 
To assess the gynecological history, this was based on 
the presence of symptoms associated with a vaginal 
infection, the history of contraceptives and the presence 
of gynecological problems . Per-vaginal examinat ion and 
investigations were done to obtain pertinent data about 
vaginal infection . The diagnosis of vaginal infection was 
determined by a physician. The results of this study show 
that women who suffered from vaginal infection were 
less likely to use cotton underwear and changed them less 
frequently (x2 = 10.1; p = 0.006 and )(l = 20.7; p = 0.001, 
respectively). Meanwhile, they were more apt to use the 
incorrect technique in washing the genital area (x2 = 26.5; 
p = 0.001), use intra-vaginal cleansing or douching {X2 = 
7.3; p = 0.007) keeping their genital area moist or using 
reused cloth for drying it (x2 = 7.3; p = 0.007). 
Women in the study group were less likely to bathe 
themselves, washing hands before and after using the 
toilet and used reusable cloth to absorb menstrual blood 
(x2 = 6.7; p = 0.009, p = 0.010 and p = 0.001, respectively). 
Meanwhile, almost one-fourth (24.0%) of the 
respondents in the case group less frequently changed 
their perinea! pad and washed their reused cloth (37.0%) 
(p = 0.023 and p = 0.001, respectively). Almost one third 
1206of women in the case group did not perform pre-or post­
coital care compared to those in the control group (X2 = 
33.8; p = 0.001, and X2 = 26.8; p = 0.001 respectively). 
Discussion 
The minimum age in this review is 15 years at which 
age a young girl can choose self-care, both personal 
hygiene and female organs. Adolescence is a period of the 
rapid growth of physical and emotional changes (Michael 
ct al., 2.Q1Q). It is the stage of life when a person enters 
puberty, but adolescents arc found to lack basic 
information about their bodies. It is still regarded as 
taboo in a developing country, but today's young people 
arc caught between the conservative culture and the 
fascinating Western culture due to the influence of the 
media (Dcshmukh & Chaniana, 2020). 
Underwear Hygiene 
In this review, three of the five papers reviewed asked 
questions related to underwear hygiene behavior. The 
questions often arising regarding the cleanliness of 
underwear arc type of underwear used and frequency of 
changing underwear. The type and cleanliness of 
undenvear and the frequency of replacement arc 
essential factors determining the risk of genital infection 
(Scvil ct al., 2.!ll.l). Many women who use underwear 
follow rhr rrf'nci whrrr rhr r~ of m:nrria1 u~Pd rannor 
absorb sweat. It is a business trend to make nylon and 
synthetic lingerie more att.ractive, especially for young 
women (Ruiz ct al., w.2). However, Felix et al. (2020) 
argued that nylon absorbs less sweat than cotton 
underwear, makes the crotch damp, and increases the 
risk of reproductive tract infections, so women must be 
wise in choosing the type of fabric in daily use. Cotton 
underwe ar is preferable to synthetic materials because 
cotton is breathable and allows air to circulate the 
external genitals. The ventilation helps to prevent the 
buildup of microorganisms and helps maintain healthy 
skin around the vaginal area (Hamed, NW-However, 
one article in this review stated that the frequency of 
genital infections was higher in those who wore the 
hosicr/conon type of underwear (Scvil et al., lQ!l). 
The use of undcnvcar is significant and needs to be 
considered. Based on ,he Middle East and Central Asia 
(MECA) guidelines on female genital hygiene 
recommends wearing loose-fitting canon underwear, 
minimizing wearing tight clothes, and changing 
underwear frequently (Arab, Almadani, Tahlak, Chawla, 
Ashouri, Tchrani::m, Ghascmi, Taheripanah, Gulyaf, & 
Khalili, lQll; Chen ct al., lQ!l). Likewise, the Royal 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists '(RCOG) 
guidance on vulvar skincare provides recommend ations 
for women to wear loose-fitting silk or cotton underwear 
and avoid close-fitting clothes (Chen et al., 1Ql1; Hilber, 
Francis, ct al., 1Q!Q). Clothing is one of the critical factors 
in the prevention of vulvovaginitis. Bacteria and yeast Jumal Nm 
thrive in moist or damp places. Therefore, clothing that 
increases local heat and moisture, such as nylon 
undenvcar and tight-fitti ng garments, including 
leotards, tights, rubber pants, skintight jeans, nylon 
underclothing, and tight-firring diapers, can contribute 
to vaginal infections and prepubenal vulvovaginitis 
(Klebanoff ct al., 2J!JQ). 
Bathing Habits 
Three studies stated that genital hygiene practices 
include bathing and toilet habits, such as bathing 
frequency, bathing position, agent used for genital area 
cleaning, and the ma,crial used for drying the genital area 
(Bahram ct al., 2009; Bitcw ct al., 1Ql1; Sevil et al., lQ!l). 
The female genitals arc constantly exposed to factors that 
affect homeostasis and especially the pH of the skin; these 
interfering factors include endogenous or physiological 
factors and exogenous or iatrogenic factors; endogenous 
factors arc moisture, sweat (sweat), sebum secretion, 
anatomical wrinkles, genetic predisposition, and age; 
exogenous factors include soap, cosmetics, tight clothing, 
bathing habits, shaving, and applying topical creams or 
powders to the skin (Arab ct al., lQ!!). 
A study by Scvil showed that history of genital 
infections was significantly more common among those 
who bathed in the sitting position. This result is 
supported by Dcmir ct al. (2020) that it is one of the 
personal hygiene habits that also contnlmte to genital 
cleansing. Women who often take a bath in the form of 
showers do not need additional applications in genital 
hygiene. Bathing by sitting on the stool may induce 
vaginal infection and urinary trace infection if the stool 
sitting is not hygienic (Dcmir ct al., 2020). On the other 
hand, Bahram ct al. (1QQ2) stated there was a significant 
correlation between bathing in standing position and the 
incidence of bacterial vaginosis. In addition to bathing 
positions affecting the incidence of genital infection s, 
other possibilities can also be influenced by cleaning 
materials or products such as soap/shampoo used when 
bathing because changes in the pH of hygiene products 
will affect the pH of the vagina. 
Women who bathed their vaginal region more 
frequently were less affected by bacterial vaginosis than 
those who did not bathe their vaginal area as much 
(Bitew ct al., lQ!l). Routine washing of the vulva is 
desirable to prevent the accumulation of vaginal 
discharge, sweat, urine, and fecal contamination to 
prevent offensive body odor. Although vulvar cleansing 
may be a helpful adjunct to medical treatment, vulvar 
cleansing products arc not designed to treat infections. 
There has, however, been a surge in intimate hygiene 
products for cleanlines s and odor control. Still, some may 
upset pH in the vulvovaginal area, which will affect the 
composition of the normal vulvovaginal microbiota 
needed for protection against infection (Chen ct al., 
lQ!l).

Menstrual Hygiene 
Current studies classify menstrual hygiene practices, 
including the material used during menstruation, 
frequency of changing the material during menstruation 
(per day), bathing during menstruation, genital douching 
during menstruation (Bahram ct al., 1222; Hamed, lQJi; 
Scvil ct al., W1). The frequency of genital infections was 
significantly higher among those who used cloth and 
those who did not want a bath during menstruation 
(p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively) (Bahram et al., 
2009). Similar results from Torondcl ct al. (2018) showed 
that women who used reusable sanitary napkins were 
more likely to gee Candida and BV infections than women 
who used disposable sanitary napkins. In addition, 
regular body washing during menstruation was 
associated with a lower risk of BV. Unhygienic menstrual 
hygiene management (MHM) practices can create 
abnormally moist conditions in the wJvovaginal area, 
which can promote opportunistic infections such as 
Candida. Once infected, it can be difficult to remove 
Candida from clothing ,vithout proper cleaning and 
drying. Menstrual blood causes changes in vaginal pH 
{alkaline pH), but the relationship between vaginal 
microbiology and menstruation is complex. In one study, 
it was stated that the menstrual sample had been shown 
to contain the highest number of bacteria at the lowest 
concentration (Amabcbc & Anumba. 2018). 
Good menstrual hygiene helps protect the intimate 
health of bacterial infections, skin irritation and other 
health problems. Research cooducted by Anand ct al. 
~ on Reproductive Tract Infections (RT!) shows that 
the causes of RTI symptoms may be different and are not 
limited to unhealthy menstrual practices , although this 
can be one of the causes of reproductive morbidity. 
Awareness, accessibility, and confiden tiality are some of 
the main concerns that require immediate attention to 
promote the use of sanitary napkins during menstrual 
periods {Anand ct al., N!i). During menstruation, the 
blood vessels in the uterus arc very susceptible to 
infection because blood and sweat come out and stick to 
the vulva, which can cause the genitaJ area to become 
moist. In moist conditions, fungi, and bacteria in the 
genital area wilJ thrive, this causes itching and infection 
in the area. One of the complaints felt during 
menstruation is itching caused by candida fungi, which 
will thrive during menstruation and can cause vaginal 
discharge and which can be caused by wearing cloth pad 
or disposable sanitary napkins. 
Coital Hygiene 
From the synthesis on coi:al hygiene, it was found 
that several female behaviors that arc often practiced arc 
genital douching before and after intercourse, urination 
after intercourse, and frequency of intercourse. Hamed 
(2015) said, in his case-control study, that almost one­
third of women in the case group did not perform pre or 
96 P-IIIN: 1858-3598 • E-155N: 2502-5191 post-coital care compared to those in the control group 
,vith statistically significant difference (p=0.001). 
Moreover, Bitew et al. UOl.Z) argued that genital hygiene 
behaviors such as douching before and after intercourse 
significantly affect the incidence of vaginal infections. 
According to Verstraclcn ct al. UO!O), the simplest 
explanation for this coital effect on the vaginal micro flora 
is that unprotected sexual intercourse changes the 
physicochemicaJ environment of the vagina and, thus, 
also influences the vaginal microflora. In particular, the 
alkaline prostate content of the ejaculate increases the 
vaginal pH, which remains elevated for up to eight hours 
after intercourse (Verstraelcn ct al., 1.Q!Q). Post-coital 
intravaginal cleansing {IVC) could counteract the 
protective effect of a vaginal microbicide (Gafos ct al., 
W1). The female genitals arc conducive to allowing 
bacteria, secretions, sweat, menstruation, urine, and 
feces to pass into the vagina during intercourse. The lack 
of ventiJation can lead to infection; it is important to be 
careful in this zone {Amabcbc & Anumba, ru!!). Post­
coital intravaginal cleansing is an important practice for 
some women in terms of managing their sexual health 
and scxualiry (Hilbcr ct al., £9.!V to increase their 
confidence with their partner and manage unwanted 
vaginal odor. The practice of coital hygiene is very 
dependent on the individual and their partner. Support 
from the sexual partners is needed to improve good coital 
hygiene behavior in the prevention of genital infections 
among women {Umami ct al.,ill!). 
This systematic review found that the incidence of 
genital infections is more common in women with 
inadequate genital hygiene (Bahram et al., 2009: Bitew ct 
al.,lO.I.Z; Calik ct al.,l020: Hamcd, :2.9.12; Sevil et al.,l.O.U). 
The prevalence of bacterial vaginosis is high and is 
influenced by individual hygiene (11,26). Inappropriate 
genital hygiene practices (Calik ct al.,1010) increased the 
risk of vaginal infection in women. The present 
systematic review shows that clothing can cause 
alterations in the vaginal microbiota due to temperature 
variation, local humidity (Calik et al., 2020; Scvil et al., 
~' and compromised ventilation of the external 
genitalia, altering the genital ecosystem and causing 
irritation, an allergic reaction, or discharge (Felix ct al., 
20ll1). Sexual intercourse leads to BV if the sexual 
partner's natural genital chemistry changes the balance 
of the vagina and causes bacteria to grow. 
Limitation 
Limitation of this study included the search was 
restricted to English and full text. There may be relevant 
information that is published in other languages. This 
evidence synthesis is based on observational studies only. 
Cross-sectional data often lack dircctionaliry and do not 
provide information on mechanistic associations or 
causal effects between genital hygiene behavior and 
genital infection. In addition, poor data quality is a 
concern, such as the lack of diagnostic data regarding 
1208genital infections, and some studies only state genital 
infection from symptoms, prior history of genital 
infection based on physician diagnoses. Due to the small 
number of papers, the five studies we reviewed were not 
strong enough to provide evidence of an association 
between genital hygiene and genital infection. There is a 
possibility of publication bias because we only used 
articles in English, presenting the possibility that articles 
using other languages also discuss the same topic as this 
study. However, we believe that the research protocol 
was methodologically strong to ensure a reliable study 
selection. For further research, it is hoped that more 
articles can be reviewed so as to reduce publication bias 
by including articles in both English and non-English 
languages and can use mcta·::inalysis to find out better 
evidence in analyzing the relationship between genital 
hygiene and genital infection. For professional health 
workers, in health services, clinics and communit y, they 
can provide health education for women, especially in 
implementing good and correct genital hygiene 
behaviors . 
Conclusion 
Hygiene behaviors that are often practiced by women 
such as underwear hygiene, bathing habits, menstrual 
hygiene, and coital hygiene seem to be an important 
factor associated with the incidence of genital infections 
in women. Women need to practice proper personal 
hygiene to avoid harmful behavior in order to prevent the 
rate of genital infections due to wrong hygiene practices. 
These factors arc in line with treatment goals centered on 
personal and reproductive hygiene care.

Dear Anil, hope all well. 
 
I know India had approved the new Intimate Wash formula but APAC also plans to launch it as well and they got 
some consumers to test the new product.  While the product is good in formulation and effectiveness, consumers 
felt the formula was too thick and did not enjoy the fragrance. Please see attached consumer report. 
 
Post the feedback, I go R&D to share some benchmarking on viscosity and please see below. Lactacyd is a leading 
product in this space and compared to lactacyd, the thickness of our proposed formula is high.

Are you aligned to the R&D team reworking the proposed formula to achieve the Lactacyd thickness and also 
improve fragrance while they do it? This would mean a 2 month development. Or would you like to move ahead 
with the current proposed formula that you and the team approved previously? Please clarify? Given’s India size, 
would go with whatever India decides.  
 
Please let me know if any questions. 
 
Thanks, 
Kunal

Dear Kunal  
Thanks for the feedback. Refer below table for foam values and viscosity.  Though the values of viscosities 
are not directly comparable due to difference in measuring parameters, on relative terms the flow 
properties are different. Proposed formula easily foams, but not too much and quickly rinses off.

Hi Dr. Atul/Shakeb, hope all well. Received the intimate wash samples today – believe they have come from you. 
  
My quick reaction, smells nice, is not watery and almost gel like – good that it will not run off from the hand or the 
intimate areas like water.  
  
The one downside of this viscosity however is would consumer perception of it being ‘sticky’ or ‘difficult to wash off’ 
‘too much foam’  
  
Had some questions related to this: 
 Can you share the viscosity of the proposed sample compared the current ‘For mums intimate wash’ 
 Could you also share viscosity of some of our other products Neem Face Wash, Hair Fall shampoo? 
 Also, do we know the foamability of the proposed sample vs the current ‘For mums intimate wash’?  
  
Thanks, 
Kunal

Sub: Violation of Intellectual Property Rights of our trademark EVECARE® by your mark EVECARE bearing 
application No. 1242530 in Class 05 
Dear Sir/s, 
This notice is being issued on behalf of Himalaya Wellness Company/ its affiliates worldwide (hereinafter 
"Himalaya "]. As you are already aware, Himalaya is a world-renowned manufacturer of a wide range of 
Ayurvedic/Herbal products. In the course of its business, spanning more than 90 years in about 160 countries 
worldwide, Himalaya has established an excellent worldwide reputation in Herbal Pharmaceutical industry. 
By virtue of long term and extensive use in respect of its various products/ corporate names of its affiliates, 
domain names and other particulars, Himalaya exclusively holds all Intellectual property rights in the name 
"HIMALAYA" . Our enforceable rights including and not limited to our trademarks, copyrights, designs and its 
derivatives are registered/app lied for in close to 160 countries worldwide. Himalaya has earned the trust and 
confidence of millions of people spread within the country and also several other countries to which it has been 
exporting its products. In the course of its business it has conceived, adopted, used a unique and distinctive 
layout, colour scheme and get-up for the labels and cartons of its products. Himalaya has taken efforts to 
popularize its products with this distinctive label and colour scheme and has spent extensively on this score due 
to which Himalaya's customers, and the general public, have come to recognize Himalaya as an established and 
successful pharmaceutical and consumer products business. 
One of our prime products is EVECARE® which has been in the market since 1998 and is known globally for its 
effectiveness for maintaining health of the reproductive organs in women. It helps to support normal 
menstruation, relieves discomfort of menstrual symptoms, promotes regularity of ovarian hormones and serves 
as a uterine tonic. 
Our trade mark EVECARE® was first adopted in 1997 and is registered as a word mark in India under the 
registration Nos. 780581 in Class 5. Further, we have multiple registrations regarding the EVECARE label, EVECARE 
1 
1362llj II! TM ~1malava

FORTE in Class 5 bearing registration no. 850290 and 3492194. The said trademark registrations are valid and 
subsisting. 
Our trademark EVECARE ® is extensively well-marketed, promoted and heavily relied on for its effectiveness. As 
a result of continuous and extensive use over a long period of time, coupled with substantial expenditure on 
promotion and publicity, EVECARE® enjoys tremendous reputation and goodwill in the market. By virtue of the 
extensive, continuous and exclusive use, Himalaya has the sole and exclusive proprietary rights on the product 
and the artistic representations thereof. 
It has brought to our notice that you have adopted a mark which is identical to our registered trade mark and a 
well-known product EVECARE ®, which is already in the market. It can be said without any doubt that this slavish 
imitation is done with a malafide intent to pass off your goods/services as ours. The details of the impugned 
mark are given below:-
I SI. No. II Applicant II Impugned Marki I Application No. II Class I

It is evident from the aforesaid that; (i) your mark EVECARE is a violation of Himalaya's Intellectual Property 
Rights; (ii) you are deliberately attempting to misrepresent and cause confusion in the minds of general 
public/unwary consumers who will be misled into thinking that your mark EVECARE is associated with our 
trademark EVECARE ®; (iii) all your actions are a clear act of misrepresentation and is calculated to injure and 
tarnish the business and goodwill of the well-known brand name of Himalaya. 
For the reasons stated above it is obvious that you have violated the proprietary rights of the registered trademark 
owner and your acts are punishable under the Intellectual Property Laws and other related laws, both civil and 
criminal, in India. 
Himalaya expressly and manifestly reserves its rights to initiate all available legal recourses under the law 
(whether expressly stated herein or not) and nothing contained herein shall be construed as a waiver of any of 
those rights, under any circumstances whatsoever. 
Himalaya would not hesitate to initiate all available legal recourses against violation of its rights. We however 
trust that the matter can be amicably resolved bet.ween us without initiating any undesirable legal proceedings. 
We therefore request you to comply with the following requirements without any delay:-
(i) Immediately take steps to cancel the registration regarding Application No. 1242530. 
(ii) Immediately cease and desist from manufacturing, branding/marketing, offer to sale and selling your 
products under the name EVECARE which is identical to the trademark EVECARE® of Himalaya; 
(iii) Immediately cease and desist from using the mark EVECARE which is identical to Himalaya's registered 
Trademark EVECARE ®;

board, labels, posters, pamphlets, brochures, magazine, journals or any other promotional materials or 
any other indicators with;
