       "'What is AI? Artificial Intelligence helps in the analysis and decoding of neural activity data. AI, in conjunction with Brain-Computer Interfaces, receives ongoing updates of internal parameters, including data on pulse durations, amplitudes, stimulation/recording densities, and electrical properties of neural tissues. Once equipped with this information, AI algorithms swiftly discern valuable insights and logical patterns within the data, enabling them to generate the desired functional results in real time. One of the applications that has resulted from this is the ability to control a computer cursor. This can help people with disabilities to operate a personal computer to get various tasks done. Another crucial application has been in neuroprosthetics and limb rehabilitation. What does this imply in the context of healthcare, equality, and our humanity itself? All this has been possible mainly due to the advancements in Artificial Intelligence technology that have propelled the development of Brain-computer Interfaces. Most of the BCI applications in the past decade have been possible with AI assistance (Zhang, et al. , 2020) [3] These applications help improve the quality of paralyzed patientâ€™s lives, help people with disabilities with their everyday activities. They have also shown a promising impact in the rehabilitation of people with neurodevelopment disorders (Papanastasiou et al. , 2017) [4] . Without AI, it was very hard to make any sense of the data (EEG, fMRI) that was gathered from BCI. '"
